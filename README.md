This project aims to recreate standard inverted mouse cursors with a more modern design. This cursor inverts the colors behind it, and this way it always stands out no matter the background. Although this feature was initially designed for people with vision problems, regular people could greatly benefit from it as well. Original inverted mouse cursors, available in Windows out the box, hasn't been updated for decades and look quite outdated as for now. This project intends to fix it by providing overhauled inverted mouse cursors. 

Design is mostly inspired by standard white mouse cursor in Windows 10/11, but few design changes were made to improve visibility specifically for inverted mouse cursors.

All cursors invert colors behind them, e.g. they become white on dark background, and black on light background:

### Note about 1-bit version
While using this cursor pack I noticed that in some apps (Microsoft Edge, Krita, CS2) in some rare ocasions cursor suddenly stops inverting colors behind it and becomes all-white, with even black borders dissapearing. Maybe it's some videodrivers issue specific to my computer. But I found out that it doesn't happen if cursor is set to 1-bit mode (black and white) — cursor will still flicker in such situations, but it keeps showing black borders and remains clearly visible. 

Therefore I created <a href="./cursors/1-bit versions/">1-bit versions</a> for most of cursors in this pack — if you experience similar problems, feel free to give them a try. As an upside, their size is hugely smaller than regular version (2.19kbs per cursor compared to 22.9kbs), while they look and feel pretty much the same. Pretty cool, right?
